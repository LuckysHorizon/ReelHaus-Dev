# Cashfree Integration - Production Ready Fixes ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed Mock Data**
- ✅ `app/events/payment/page.tsx` - Removed mock payment data, now fetches from API
- ✅ Created `app/api/payments/[registrationId]/route.ts` - Real payment data endpoint

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- ✅ `lib/cashfree.ts` - Better error logging and validation
- ✅ `app/events/[id]/register/page.tsx` - Detailed error messages for Cashfree failures
- ✅ `app/api/payments/create-order/route.ts` - Proper error propagation
- ✅ `app/api/events/[id]/register/route.ts` - Proper error propagation

### 3. **Improved Debugging**
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging in Cashfree SDK
- ✅ Added console logs in frontend checkout process
- ✅ Created test endpoint: `/api/test-cashfree`

## Production Environment Variables Required

Set these on Render (Production):

```bash
# Cashfree Live Keys
CASHFREE_APP_ID=your_live_app_id
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=your_live_secret_key
CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Base URL for webhooks and redirects
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://reelhaus.in
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. **Test Cashfree Connection**
Visit: `https://reelhaus.in/api/test-cashfree`
- Should return success with test order details
- If fails, check environment variables

### 2. **Test Event Registration Flow**
1. Go to any event page
2. Click "Register Now"
3. Fill form and click "Proceed to Payment"
4. Check browser console for logs:
   - "Cashfree SDK loaded, initializing..."
   - "Cashfree initialized with mode: production"
   - "Opening Cashfree checkout with session: [session_id]"

### 3. **Check Network Tab**
- POST to `/api/payments/create-order` should return 200
- Response should include `cashfree_payment_session_id`
- If 502 error, check server logs for Cashfree API errors

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cashfree Error: undefined"
**Solution**: Check environment variables are set correctly on Render

### Issue: Payment modal doesn't open
**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Issue: "Payment gateway error"
**Solution**: Check server logs for detailed Cashfree API response

### Issue: Webhook not working
**Solution**: Ensure webhook URL is `https://reelhaus.in/api/webhooks/cashfree`

## API Endpoints Status

| Endpoint | Status | Purpose |

2. **Test** `/api/test-cashfree` endpoint
3. **Test** full registration flow
4. **Configure** webhooks in Cashfree dashboard
5. **Monitor** logs for any issues
