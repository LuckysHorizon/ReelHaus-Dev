# 🔧 Build Error Fix - Razorpay to Cashfree Migration

## Issue Fixed
The build was failing with:
```
Error: `key_id` or `oauthToken` is mandatory
```

This was caused by **remaining Razorpay code** in the application that was trying to initialize Razorpay with missing credentials.

---

## ✅ Files Updated

### 1. **`app/api/events/[id]/register/route.ts`**
**Before**: Used Razorpay SDK
```typescript
import Razorpay from 'razorpay'

const razorpay = new Razorpay({
  key_id: process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY_ID!,
  key_secret: process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET!
})

const razorpayOrder = await razorpay.orders.create({...})
```

**After**: Uses Cashfree SDK
```typescript
import { cashfree } from '@/lib/cashfree'

const cashfreeOrder = await cashfree.createOrder({...})
```

### 2. **`app/events/payment/page.tsx`**
**Before**: Used Razorpay checkout
```typescript
declare global {
  interface Window {
    Razorpay: any
  }
}

// Load Razorpay script
script.src = 'https://checkout.razorpay.com/v1/checkout.js'
```

**After**: Uses Cashfree checkout
```typescript
declare global {
  interface Window {
    Cashfree: any
  }
}

// Load Cashfree script
script.src = 'https://sdk.cashfree.com/js/v3/cashfree.js'
```

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

1. **Removed Razorpay SDK imports** from API routes
2. **Replaced Razorpay order creation** with Cashfree order creation
3. **Updated payment page** to use Cashfree checkout
4. **Updated response fields** to use Cashfree-specific data
5. **Fixed provider name** from `'razorpay'` to `'cashfree'`

---

## ✅ Build Status

- **Before**: ❌ Build failed due to missing Razorpay credentials
