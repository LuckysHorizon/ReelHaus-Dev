# Build Errors Fixed - Dynamic Route Conflicts Resolved ✅

## Issue Identified
**Error**: `You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path ('id' !== 'registrationId')`

This occurred because Next.js detected conflicting dynamic routes with different parameter names at the same level.

## Root Cause
The conflict was caused by having multiple dynamic routes with different parameter names:
- `app/api/registrations/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/registrations/[registrationId]/route.ts` (conflicting)
- `app/api/payments/[registrationId]/route.ts` (conflicting)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Removed Conflicting Routes**
- ✅ Deleted `app/api/registrations/[registrationId]/route.ts`
- ✅ Deleted `app/api/payments/[registrationId]/route.ts`

### 2. **Updated API Endpoints**
- ✅ Updated `app/events/payment/success/page.tsx` to use existing `/api/registrations/${registrationId}`
- ✅ Created `app/api/payment-data/route.ts` for payment data fetching
- ✅ Updated `app/events/payment/page.tsx` to use `/api/payment-data?registrationId=${registrationId}`

### 3. **Maintained Functionality**
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Payment flow remains intact
- ✅ Success page data fetching works
- ✅ Email confirmation system functional

## Current API Structure (No Conflicts)

```

├── events/[id]/register/          # Event registration
