## Testing Steps

### 1. **Test Payment Flow**
1. Go to any event registration page
2. Fill form and click "Proceed to Payment"
3. Complete payment in Cashfree modal
4. Check browser console for logs:
   - "Cashfree checkout response: [response]"
   - "Payment verification response: [response]"

### 2. **Check Server Logs**
Look for these log messages:
- `[Payment Verify] Verifying payment for order: [order_id]`
- `[Payment Verify] Payment verified successfully: [payment_id]`
- `[Payment Verify] Payment record updated successfully`
- `[Payment Verify] Registration status updated successfully`
- `[Payment Verify] Confirmation emails sent successfully`

### 3. **Verify Database Updates**
- Check `payments` table: `status` should be 'succeeded'
- Check `registrations` table: `status` should be 'paid'
- Check `events` table: `seats_available` should be decremented

### 4. **Check Email Delivery**
- Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in environment variables
- Check email logs for confirmation emails
- Look for `[Payment Verify] Confirmation emails sent successfully`

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Cashfree (Production)
CASHFREE_APP_ID=your_live_app_id
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=your_live_secret_key
CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Email Service
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# Base URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://reelhaus.in
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Payment verification failed"
**Solution**: Check server logs for detailed error messages

### Issue: "Registration not found"
**Solution**: Verify registration was created before payment

### Issue: "Email sending failed"
**Solution**: Check RESEND_API_KEY is configured correctly

### Issue: "Payment not successful"
**Solution**: Verify Cashfree payment status in their dashboard

## Expected Flow

1. **User completes payment** → Cashfree returns success
2. **Frontend calls verification** → `/api/payments/verify`
3. **Backend verifies with Cashfree** → Confirms payment status
4. **Database updates** → Payment record + Registration status
5. **Email sent** → Confirmation to all attendees
6. **Success page** → Shows real data from database

The payment success page should now display:
- ✅ Real event details
- ✅ Correct payment amount
- ✅ User email address
- ✅ Payment ID
- ✅ Confirmation email sent

All issues have been resolved with comprehensive logging for easy debugging!
